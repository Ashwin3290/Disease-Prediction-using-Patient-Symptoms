# Disease Prediction using Patient Symptoms

Introduction
---
Over 75% of the healthcare infrastructure is concentrated in metro cities, where only 27% of the total population residesâ€”the rest 73% of the Indian population lack even basic medical facilities. The primary medical centers are lacking over 3,000 doctors and in the last decade, the shortage has increased by ~200%

To contribute in solving this problem I have made an API that can be used to predict what a patient is suffering from the person's symptoms and then using random forest classification to accurately predict what the person is suffering from. 

Current accuracy:**97.4%**
